# Introduction

Bosch Sensortec offers a toolkit for evaluation of it’s sensor products.The toolkit consisting of 3
elements:

1. A sensor specific shuttle board also known as breakout board.
APP3.0 shuttle boards also known as mini shuttle boards has smaller form factor when compared with APP2.0 shuttle board.

2. [Application Board](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/tools/application-board-3-0/) has a connector for the shuttle board and serves as interface translator from the sensor interface (I~2~C or SPI) to a USB interface, allowing PC software to communicate with the sensor on the shuttle.

3. On the PC side, Bosch Sensortec provides the software packages Development Desktop 2.0 and COINES to connect to the sensor on the Application Board.

    - Development Desktop 2.0 provides a GUI which allows to configure the sensor, plot and export streamed sensor data.

    - COINES provides a C based interface, which allows to communicate with the sensor using the SensorAPI from Bosch Sensortec on the PC side.

    - Starting from COINES v2.0, user has an option to cross-compile the example and run it directly on the Application Board’s microcontroller.
